That image doesn't have to be the only HTML in the element &ndash; the script will use the first image it finds. The only thing you need to provide is the total number of images you want to rotate through. The script assumes you've numbered your images like: \"image1.jpg\", \"image2.jpg\", \"image3.jpg\", &amp;c.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"fader1\">\r\n    <span><img src=\"images/fader1/1.jpg\"></span>\r\n</div>\r\n<script>\r\n    $('#fader1').simplefader( 4 );\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe image you provide doesn't have to be the first image in your series, but you do need to have images starting at 1. It will start fading from the image you provide, working in order.\r\n    \r\nYou can optionally pass in an options object. Here are the options you can set:\r\n\r\n  * speed &ndash; the speed of rotation in ms (default: 5000)\r\n  * animationSpeed &ndash; the speed of fading animation in ms (default: 600)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"fader2\">\r\n    <img src=\"images/fader2/image3.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n<script>\r\n    $('#fader2').simplefader( 4, { speed: 2500, animationSpeed: 300 } );\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBrowse the `demo.html` file to see it in action.\r\n","google":"UA-96981-10","tagline":"jSimpleFader is a jQuery plugin to simply fade between images."}
